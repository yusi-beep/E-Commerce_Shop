Feature: Header branding & navbar enhancements

Homepage logo button

Allow admins to upload, replace, and delete a store logo image.

Render the logo in the site header as a clickable button linking to the homepage (/).

Support SVG/PNG (prefer SVG). Enforce max file size (e.g., 512 KB) and dimensions (e.g., ≤ 256×256 px for PNG).

Store both original and a resized/optimized variant. Serve with proper caching headers.

Include alt text (editable) for accessibility and SEO.

Browser tab icon (favicon)

Allow admins to upload a favicon (ICO/PNG/SVG). Generate and serve the following:

favicon.ico (fallback), favicon.svg, 32×32 and 16×16 PNG.

Apple Touch Icon (180×180), Android/manifest icons if PWA is enabled.

Inject <link rel="icon"> and related <link> tags into <head> across all pages.

Navbar integration

Place Cart and Orders as navbar items (right-aligned). Each item shows:

Cart: icon + item count badge (live-updated).

Orders: icon + label; if authenticated, link to /account/orders; else link to sign-in.

Navbar must be responsive (mobile: collapsible menu / hamburger).

Expose a CSS class API (e.g., .navbar, .navbar-brand, .navbar-actions, .btn-icon, .badge) so design can be restyled via CSS only.

Provide focus states, ARIA roles (role="navigation"), and keyboard navigation.

Admin UI

Settings page: Branding → fields:

Site logo (upload/delete), alt text, max width (px), link target (default /).

Favicon upload (auto-generate sizes).

Show preview and “Reset to default” actions.

Server-side validation + helpful error messages.

Performance & accessibility

Serve images with correct width/height, loading="eager" for logo, decoding="async".

Use prefetch/preload for critical assets where appropriate.

WCAG 2.1 AA: color contrast for navbar, visible focus outline.

Lighthouse ≥ 90 for Performance/Best Practices/Accessibility on header route.

Security & storage

Validate MIME type and scan images.

Store assets in the media bucket with unique names; purge CDN on change.

Acceptance criteria

Admin can upload/edit/delete logo; header updates immediately.

Clicking the logo navigates to /.

Favicon displays on all major browsers and devices.

Cart & Orders appear in the navbar (desktop & mobile), styled via CSS only.

No layout shift (CLS) introduced by header assets.
